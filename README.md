Electricity billing system
=======================
I make this project for my own improvement.

How to run this project
--------

1) Firstly, you need to run the ***docker-compose.yml*** file because this create a docker container.
In this container you can find the database.
2) Then you can run the project


Please note that **the database is empty**, so you need to put some data in it!
- First you need to register clients.
- Second add consumption to the clients.

You can easily add data to the database with **Swagger**.

Here you can find the endpoints: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/
